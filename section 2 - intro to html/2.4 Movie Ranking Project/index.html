 <h3>everything, everywhere, all at once</h3>
 <p>this movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time to this day. i think it's because it's something that hits so close to home, something i relate to completely. i left the movie theatre crying so many tears that day.</p>
 <h3>the substance</h3>
 <p>just watched this a couple days ago and again with my boyfriend. what a masterpiece. the symbolism, the colors, the actors, the themes, the many layers of deeper meanings, it was such an incredible movie. it made me so uncomfortable but that's what made it good.</p>
 <h3>pitch perfect</h3>
 <p>OH OOH OH OOH OH OH DADADA I I GOT A NEW LIFE YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE ME IM SO GLAD</p>
